Hi everyone, welcome to my webpage! Here I’ll be sharing not only what I have created so far, but also some of my ideas and reflections on art.  

I see myself as a multidisciplinary artist, moving between different forms of art, science, and media. Through this mix, I try to express emotions, my questions about the world, and imagine how it could be better.  

My works are less about telling stories and more about exploring who we are and what we can become. Some of them never reached the public: improvisations and drafts that may remain unfinished. Yet even these are part of my process, because for me every creation is also an investigation.  

Art, to me, is not only about presenting something finished. It is a path of self-discovery, a way to grow and to become a little better than I was yesterday.  

In the next posts I’ll share more about my work and my journey. Stay tuned!

I am a cross- and transdisciplinary artist working at the intersection of mime, physical theater, dance, performance, and live art.

Born in São Paulo, Brazil, I earned my Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Ph.D. in Physics, before fully embracing the performing arts. I trained in Total Mime and Physical Theatre at the Luis Louis Studio (2016) and deepened my studies in Corporeal Mime and Theater with Corine Soum, Steve Wasson, Marc Duncan, Tania Coke, Maurício Paroni, Ulrika Malmgreen, and others.

My dance training spans modern and contemporary techniques—including Graham Technique, Eutonia, Body Awareness methods, Contact and Improvisation, and Indigenous Dances—with mentors such as Daniela Stasi, Miriam Dascal, Fredyson Cunha, and Lu Favoretto.

As a performer, I had the privilege to work and study with Ntando Cele, Elisa Band, Cadu Ribeiro, Elle de Bernardini, Elton Panamby, Estela Lapponi, Ierê Papá, Lucio Agra, Marcos Bulhões, and T. Angel.

I began my artistic journey with the electric guitar, learning from masters like André Christovam.

I am the founder of the π3 company (2021–present). I also participated in the Impromime group (2017), directed by Fábio Lins, and the AANGA dance-theater group (2015–2016), directed by Miriam Dascal.

Below you will find a detailed overview of my studies and artistic explorations. I am always evolving, committed to continuous learning and experimentation.

## Ballroom Dances
Nearly 15 years of intensive study in ballroom dances, with specialized focus on forró and tango under the guidance of renowned masters. This extensive training has deepened my understanding of partnering dynamics, musical interpretation, and the subtle art of leading and following—skills that profoundly inform my approach to physical theater and corporeal expression.

**Forró:** Developed traditional and contemporary techniques, exploring the dance's roots in Brazilian folk culture and its evolution into urban social expression.

**Tango:** Comprehensive training in Argentine tango, including technique, musicality, and the philosophical aspects of connection and improvisation within structure.

This ballroom foundation enhances my ability to work with spatial relationships, timing, and the delicate balance between control and surrender that defines both partnered dance and theatrical collaboration.

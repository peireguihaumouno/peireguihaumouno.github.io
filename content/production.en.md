Here I share some of my experience working in cultural production.  
All the plays I created were also produced by myself, with a particular focus on *digital communication*.  

I was the founder and producer of the project *Arrabalera Tango* (2016–2021), which aimed to popularize tango in São Paulo through an irreverent and innovative approach.  
In 2017, I organized the *Arrabalera Tango Festival*, a weekend of performances and classes featuring leading figures from the tango scene.  

I also founded and coordinated *TangoLAB – USP (Chemistry)* (2016-2021), offering tango classes at the University of São Paulo.
